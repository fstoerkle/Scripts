Florian's Scripts
=================

Some small scripts, not necessarily created by me.
Some are used often and some not so often.

*  `colors-show`: displays the color scheme used in the current Terminal profile
*  `gibo`: copy a basic gitignore file from github.com/github/gitignore ([source] [1])
*  `serve-php`: start a PHP server in the working directory
*  `server-static`: start a web server serving static files from the working directory
*  `ssh-copy-id`: copy your SSH key to a remote machine (source: some Debian system)
*  `upper`: update all package manager packages, like `brew`, `npm`, etcâ€¦
*  `urlencode`: as the name implies ;)
